Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

100 simulations and especially 10 simulations were not that precise compared to the others.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

At about 10000 simulations, as it's almost instant for humans on my tests and the numbers are kinda close.
