If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
   Three values would represent the audio aura of the songs by taking the values of the three averages with: SELECT AVG (energy), AVG (valence), and AVG (danceability) FROM songs; similarly, three values representing red, green, and blue represent a colour.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    A user who only plays music with energy, valence, and danceability values of 0.5 would have the same auditory experience as a user who plays music with a wide range of energy, valence, and danceability values but ultimately achieves an average of 0.5 for each.

    Consequently, it might be more accurate to depict their musical preferences by using six values instead of just three: the standard deviations of each of the energy, valence, and danceability averages.
